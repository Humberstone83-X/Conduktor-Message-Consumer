The Conduktor Message Consumer is a lightweight consumer project designed to receive messages sent from Conduktor and trigger a Lambda function. It serves as an intermediary between Conduktor, a platform for Apache Kafka development, and AWS Lambda functions. The project allows users to locally consume messages from Conduktor and invoke Lambda functions for further processing or analysis.
